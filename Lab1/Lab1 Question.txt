Question : Write a Python program that creates a matrix of 10 by 10 using the Data provided below. 
	Place the following data into a file and read the data into the matrix from a file called “Data.txt”
	Select three columns, columns 3, 1, and 9, sort them in ascending order of column 3 and make a matrix of 10 by 3 using these three columns
	Select another set of three columns, columns 5, 2, 7, sort them in descending order of column 5 and make a matrix of 10 by 3 using these three columns - Call it matrix2. 
	Add the two sorted matrices to each other and put the result into another 10 by 3 matrix call it matrix3. No need to sort matrix 3.
	Add the content of each row of Matrix 3 and put it into a new 10 by 1 matrix call it Matrix 4.
	Sort Matrix4 in ascending order
